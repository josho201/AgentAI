## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Core Innovations
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**:
  - 120b model: 128 experts per layer, **4 active per token**
  - 20b model: 32 experts per layer, **4 active per token**
  - Enables massive parameter counts while maintaining efficient inference
- **4-bit Quantization (MXFP4)**:
  - Applied exclusively to MoE weights
  - Allows 120b model to fit on a single H100 GPU (80GB VRAM)
  - 20b model runs on **16GB VRAM** (consumer-grade hardware)
- **128K Context Window**:
  - Achieved via **YaRN** (Yet another RoPE-based method)
  - Alternating attention layers: 128-token sliding window + full-context attention

## Conclusion
The GPT-OSS family represents a strategic milestone for OpenAI, bridging the gap between closed commercial models and fully open ecosystems. While not as permissive as community-driven projects (e.g., Meta's Llama 3), its Apache 2.0 licensing and hardware-optimized design enable unprecedented access to high-capacity reasoning models. Developers should prioritize the 20b variant for edge applications and 120b for cloud-scale deployments, leveraging the harmony encoding system for tailored reasoning workflows.
